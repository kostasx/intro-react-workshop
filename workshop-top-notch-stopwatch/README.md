# Workshop: Build a stopwatch

The goal is to build a timer that you can start, pause and reset back to 0.

Write your code in `index.html` (no peaking in the solution files for now!)

**Hint 1:** You're going to need `componentDidMount`

  <p>If you haven't build timers in JavaScript before you might want to look at [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)
</details>

### Stretch goal

If you're done early see if you can create buttons for adding and removing additional timers from the page.

Can you see a potential bug in your code that might develop if you're removing stopwatches from the DOM? How could you fix it?
